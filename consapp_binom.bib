ABSTRACT = {The increase in available probabilistic information and its usefulness for understanding the world has made it necessary to promote probabilistic literate citizens. For this, the binomial distribution is fundamental as one of the most important distributions for understanding random phenomena and effective decision making, and as a facilitator for the understanding of mathematical and probabilistic notions such as the normal distribution. However, to understand it effectively, it is necessary to consider how it has developed throughout history, that is, the components that gave it the form and meaning that we know today. To address this perspective, we identify the problem situations that gave origin to the binomial distribution, the operational and discursive practices developed to find solutions, and the conflicts that caused a leap in mathematical and probability heuristics, culminating in what is now known as the binomial distribution formula. As a result, we present five historical links to the binomial phenomenon where problem situations of increasing complexity were addressed: a case study using informal means (such as direct counting), the formalization of numerical patterns and constructs related to counting cases, specific probability calculus, the study and modeling of probability in variable or complex phenomena, and the use of the distribution formula as a tool to approaching notions such as the normal distribution. The periods and situations identified correspond to a required step in the design of binomial distribution learning from a historical epistemological perspective and when solving conflicts.},

 abstract = {The sum of k independent and identically distributed (0, 1) variables has a binomial distribution. If the variables are identically distributed but not independent, this may be generalized to a two-parameter distribution where the k variables are assumed to have a symmetric joint distribution with no second- or higher-order "interactions". Two distinct generalizations are obtained, depending on whether the "multiplicative" or "additive" definition of "interaction" for discrete variables is used. The multiplicative generalization gives rise to a two-parameter exponential family, which naturally includes the binomial as a special case. Whereas with a beta-binomially distributed variable the variance always exceeds the corresponding binomial variance, the "additive" or "multiplicative" generalizations allow the variance to be greater or less than the corresponding binomial quantity. The properties of these two distributions are discussed, and both distributions are fitted, successfully, to data given by Skellam (1948) on the secondary association of chromosomes in Brassica.},

 abstract = {We examine how the binomial distribution B(n, p) arises as the distribution Sn = ∑i=1n Xi of an arbitrary sequence of Bernoulli variables. It is shown that B (n, p) arises in infinitely many ways as the distribution of dependent and non-identical Bernoulli variables, and arises uniquely as that of independent Bernoulli variables. A number of illustrative examples are given. The cases B(2, p) and B(3, p) are completely analyzed to bring out some of the intrinsic properties of the binomial distribution. The conditions under which Sn follows B(n, p), given that Sn-1 is not necessarily a binomial variable, are investigated. Several natural characterizations of B(n , p), including one which relates the binomial distributions and the Poisson process, are also given.These results and characterizations lead to a better understanding of the nature of the binomial distribution and enhance the utility.},
