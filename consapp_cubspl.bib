abstract = {In this paper a fourth order asymptotically optimal error bound for a new cubic interpolating spline function, denoted by Q-spline, is derived for the case that only function values at given points are used but not any derivative information. The bound seems to be stronger than earlier error bounds for cubic spline interpolation in such setting such as the not-a-knot spline. A brief analysis of the conditioning of the end conditions of cubic spline interpolation leads to a modification of the not-a-knot spline, and some numerical examples suggest that the interpolation error of this revised not-a-knot spline generally is comparable to the near optimal Q-spline and lower than for the not-a-knot spline when the mesh size is small.}

abstract="This chapter reiterates the subject of the previous chapter. Instead of a rational cubic model, a polynomial cubic spline has been presented here for the same objective. A piecewise cubic spline has been introduced to preserve the shape of the data when it is convex, monotone or positive. The spline representation is interpolatory and applicable to the scalar valued data. The shape parameters, in the description of the cubic, have been constrained in such a way that they control the shape of the curve to avoid any noise. As far as visual smoothness is concerned, the curve scheme under discussion is GC1. Thus the continuity constraints have been relaxed from C1 to GC1.",

The processes of separating parts into scales have been studied. During the work, the B-spline function was selected as the most convenient mathematical model for digital processing of EEG signals, and the construction of the B-spline function was presented.

abstract="Spline interpolation is an improvement over piecewise --- polynomial interpolation. It uses less information of the given function, yet furnishes smoother interpolates. The plan of this chapter is as follows: In Section6.2 we shall define the spline space Sm,$\tau$($\Delta$), and for a given function x (t) the spline and Lidstone --- spline interpolates Sm,$\tau$$\Delta$and LSm,2m−2$\Delta$x(t),respectively. Here, we shall also show that to acquire the bounds for {\textbardbl} Dk(x− Sm,$\tau$$\Delta$) {\textbardbl}∞ and {\textbardbl} Dk(x− LSm,2m−2$\Delta$x) {\textbardbl}∞ in terms of the derivatives of x(t) it is necessary to estimate several terms. While some of these terms can be estimated by the results of Chapter 5, other terms which require a different analysis for each m and $\tau$, need to be bounded. In Sections6.3,6.4 and 6.6 respectively, we shall consider the cases m = 2, $\tau$ = 2; m = 3, $\tau$ = 4 and m = 3, $\tau$ = 3. These cases correspond to cubic in the class C(2) [a, b], and quintic in the classes C(4)[a, b] and C(3)[a, b] spline interpolates. For the cases m = 3, $\tau$ = 4 and m = 3, $\tau$ = 3 in Sections 6.5 and 6.7 respectively, we shall discuss the construction of approximated quintic splines, and for these interpolates we will provide explicit error bounds in L∞ --- norm. For the cubic and quintic Lidstone --- spline interpolates error bounds in L∞ --- norm are obtained in Sections 6.8 and 6.9, respectively. In Section6.10 we shall extend Theorems 5.3.16 and 5.3.17 for the spline interpolate Sm,$\tau$$\Delta$x(t)",

abstract = {Evoked potentials and EEGs record punctuate electrical activity at electrode sites. To represent the overall potential distribution on the entire scalp it is necessary to interpolate between these sampled values. Surface splines are mathematical tools for interpolating functions of two variables. In comparison to the classical methods of interpolation, based on linear combination of the potentials of the 4 nearest electrodes, spline methods are smoother, give more precisely located extrema and converge faster toward the ‘true’ potential surface when the number of recording electrodes is increased. These advantages are at the expense of lengthier computation time.
Résumé
Les potentiels évoqués comme l'électroencéphalographie n'enregistrent l'activité électrique du scalp qu'en des points précis correspondant à l'emplacement des électrodes. Pour avoir une représentation globale de la distribution du potentiel sur le scalp, il est nécessaire d'interpoler entre ces points de mesure. Les surfaces splines permettent d'effectuer de telles interpolations bi-dimensionnelles. Par comparaison avec la méthode d'interpolation couramment utilisée basée sur la combinaison linéaire des potentiels des 4 plus proches électrodes la méthode des splines donne des surfaces plus régulières, les extrêmes sont mieux localisés et quand on augmente le nombre d'électrodes, les surfaces obtenues convergent plus rapidement vers la ‘vraie’ surface. En contrepartie le calcul de ces fonctions est plus long.}

The use of simple statistical comparison methods on recorded EEG maps allowed us to evaluate the qualities of interpolation methods belonging to 3 mathematical families (barycentric, polynomial, spline). A combination of a 3-dimensional representation of EEG maps and a reliable interpolation method makes it possible to obtain better spatial resolution than with standard planar mapping.}

abstract = {Traditional end conditions for cubic spline interpolation consist of values, the first or the second derivatives of interpolated functions on the boundary interpolation knots. The not-a-knot end condition proposed by de Boor (1985) is a kind of end condition of cubic spline interpolation for the practical application without the requirements of the derivatives at the end knots. However, a significant disadvantage of such end condition is that there is a sharp decrease in the accuracy of the interpolation at boundary intervals. In this paper, by changing the locations of two spline knots in not-a-knot end condition, we propose the optimal arrangement of shifted spline knots for cubic spline interpolation. The proposed scheme leads to an approximately 3.4 times increasing in the accuracy of the interpolation compared to the de Boor’s not-a-knot end condition. Furthermore, we also present the optimal end conditions of cubic spline interpolation to approximate the first and the second derivatives of interpolated functions. The representative examples show the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method.}

abstract={Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is usually suffered from motion artifacts, generated randomly during signal acquisition timings. These artifacts sturdily affect the investigation and therefore, diagnosis of neural diseases from EEG signal. The artifact removal may cause loss of important information from the signal. Therefore, it is required to remove the motion artifacts and simultaneously preserve the desired information, which makes EEG artifact removal a vital task. Enhanced Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) is the most widespread method used for artifact removal, as it is a data-driven based feature extraction method. In this research work the efficiency of various EEMD with different interpolation based artifact removal method have been compared. The EEMD is used to convert input single channel EEG signal to a multichannel signal, and in order to remove the randomness of motion artifact, CCA and DWT filtering were used successively. The performance of different interpolation based artifact removal methods have evaluated and results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for use as a supplement to algorithms currently in use as it offers improvements in DSNR and various other performance parameters.},

To this end optimal control theory for state-restricted optimal control problems is applied. The necessary conditions yield a complete characterization of the optimal spline. In the case of two or three interpolation knots, which we call thelocalcase, the optimality conditions are treated analytically. They reduce to polynomial equations which can very easily be solved numerically. These results are used for the construction of a numerical algorithm for the optimal monotone spline in the general (global) case via Newton's method. Here, the local optimal spline serves as a favourable initial estimation for the additional grid points of the optimal spline. Some numerical examples are presented which are constructed by FORTRAN and MATLAB programs.}
