abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement method for brain activity. Due to its safety, high resolution, and hypersensitivity to dynamic changes in brain neural signals, EEG has aroused much interest in scientific research and medical fields. This article reviews the types of EEG signals, multiple EEG signal analysis methods, and the application of relevant methods in the neuroscience field and for diagnosing neurological diseases. First, three types of EEG signals, including time-invariant EEG, accurate event-related EEG, and random event-related EEG, are introduced. Second, five main directions for the methods of EEG analysis, including power spectrum analysis, time–frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, source localization methods, and machine learning methods, are described in the main section, along with different sub-methods and effect evaluations for solving the same problem. Finally, the application scenarios of different EEG analysis methods are emphasized, and the advantages and disadvantages of similar methods are distinguished. This article is expected to assist researchers in selecting suitable EEG analysis methods based on their research objectives, provide references for subsequent research, and summarize current issues and prospects for the future.},

abstract="The use of mathematical models for electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been going on for many years, and currently they are starting to find a place both in clinical practice and in parallel with other methods for evaluation of brain activity. The use and interpretation of these methods are not possible without knowledge of the basic mechanisms and processes that underlie the results obtained from their application. The advantages of the quantitative methods, the processes underlying their presentation, and the optimal parameters used, such as the number of electrodes and time intervals, have been evaluated. Attention has been paid to the advantages of the individual possibilities for EEG signal analysis---absolute and relative power as well as coherence. An analysis of these defined quantities provides an opportunity to enter into the intimate mechanisms underlying specific psychopathological phenomena.",

abstract = {Studies of hemisphere function involving the use of coherence analysis are reviewed. Despite the fact that many effects related to subject group and type of task have been reported, few seem to be reliable across studies. The assumptions which seem to underlie the use of coherence analysis are made explicit and discussed. Most investigators consider coherence levels to reflect certain ‘baseline’ patterns, possibly related to structural connectivity, upon which task and/or strategy effects may be superimposed. Use of a cephalic reference renders coherence effects virtually uninterpretable for a variety of reasons which are fully discussed.}

abstract = {Human brain consists of millions of neurons which are playing an important role for controlling behavior of human body with respect to internal/external motor/sensory stimuli. These neurons will act as information carriers between human body and brain. Understanding cognitive behaviour of brain can be done by analyzing either signals or images from the brain. Human behaviour can be visualized in terms of motor and sensory states such as, eye movement, lip movement, remembrance, attention, hand clenching etc. These states are related with specific signal frequency which helps to understand functional behavior of complex brain structure. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an efficient modality which helps to acquire brain signals corresponds to various states from the scalp surface area. These signals are generally categorized as delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma based on signal frequencies ranges from 0.1Hz to more than 100Hz. This paper primarily focuses on EEG signals and its characterization with respect to various states of human body. It also deals with experimental setup used in EEG analysis.}
