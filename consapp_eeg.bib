abstract={Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive measurement method for brain activity. Due to its safety, high resolution, and hypersensitivity to dynamic changes in brain neural signals, EEG has aroused much interest in scientific research and medical fields. This article reviews the types of EEG signals, multiple EEG signal analysis methods, and the application of relevant methods in the neuroscience field and for diagnosing neurological diseases. First, three types of EEG signals, including time-invariant EEG, accurate event-related EEG, and random event-related EEG, are introduced. Second, five main directions for the methods of EEG analysis, including power spectrum analysis, time–frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, source localization methods, and machine learning methods, are described in the main section, along with different sub-methods and effect evaluations for solving the same problem. Finally, the application scenarios of different EEG analysis methods are emphasized, and the advantages and disadvantages of similar methods are distinguished. This article is expected to assist researchers in selecting suitable EEG analysis methods based on their research objectives, provide references for subsequent research, and summarize current issues and prospects for the future.},

abstract="The use of mathematical models for electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been going on for many years, and currently they are starting to find a place both in clinical practice and in parallel with other methods for evaluation of brain activity. The use and interpretation of these methods are not possible without knowledge of the basic mechanisms and processes that underlie the results obtained from their application. The advantages of the quantitative methods, the processes underlying their presentation, and the optimal parameters used, such as the number of electrodes and time intervals, have been evaluated. Attention has been paid to the advantages of the individual possibilities for EEG signal analysis---absolute and relative power as well as coherence. An analysis of these defined quantities provides an opportunity to enter into the intimate mechanisms underlying specific psychopathological phenomena.",

Despite the fact that many effects related to subject group and type of task have been reported, few seem to be reliable across studies. The assumptions which seem to underlie the use of coherence analysis are made explicit and discussed. Most investigators consider coherence levels to reflect certain ‘baseline’ patterns, possibly related to structural connectivity, upon which task and/or strategy effects may be superimposed. Use of a cephalic reference renders coherence effects virtually uninterpretable for a variety of reasons which are fully discussed.}

abstract = {Human brain consists of millions of neurons which are playing an important role for controlling behavior of human body with respect to internal/external motor/sensory stimuli. These neurons will act as information carriers between human body and brain. Understanding cognitive behaviour of brain can be done by analyzing either signals or images from the brain. Human behaviour can be visualized in terms of motor and sensory states such as, eye movement, lip movement, remembrance, attention, hand clenching etc. These states are related with specific signal frequency which helps to understand functional behavior of complex brain structure. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an efficient modality which helps to acquire brain signals corresponds to various states from the scalp surface area. These signals are generally categorized as delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma based on signal frequencies ranges from 0.1Hz to more than 100Hz. This paper primarily focuses on EEG signals and its characterization with respect to various states of human body. It also deals with experimental setup used in EEG analysis.}

abstract = {We review research on the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence, stating that brighter individuals display lower (more efficient) brain activation while performing cognitive tasks [Haier, R.J., Siegel, B.V., Nuechterlein, K.H., Hazlett, E., Wu, J.C., Paek, J., Browning, H.L., Buchsbaum, M.S., 1988. Cortical glucose metabolic rate correlates of abstract reasoning and attention studied with positron emission tomography. Intelligence 12, 199–217]. While most early studies confirmed this hypothesis later research has revealed contradictory evidence or has identified some moderating variables like sex, task type, task complexity or brain area. Neuroscientific training studies suggest that neural efficiency also seems to be a function of the amount and quality of learning. From integrating this evidence we conclude that neural efficiency might arise when individuals are confronted with tasks of (subjectively) low to moderate task difficulty and it is mainly observable for frontal brain areas. This is true for easier novel cognitive tasks or after sufficient practice allowing participants to develop appropriate (efficient) strategies to deal with the task. In very complex tasks more able individuals seem to invest more cortical resources resulting in positive correlations between brain usage and cognitive ability. Based on the reviewed evidence we propose future empirical approaches in this field.}

abstract = {In studying physiological correlates of human intelligence, new brain imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and electroencephalography (EEG) mapping methods focus on the level and topographical distribution of cortical activation. Actually, there is strong empirical evidence that more intelligent individuals display a more focused cortical activation during cognitive performance resulting in lower total brain activation than in less intelligent individuals (i.e., neural efficiency hypothesis). Former studies have used only single, homogeneous tasks and most of the studies have been performed using males. Therefore, here the influence of different task content and of sex on the relationship between intelligence and cortical activation has been tested. In a sample of 26 males and 25 females, we administered verbal, numerical, and figural versions of a well-known elementary cognitive task, the so-called Posner task. Our results suggest a comparatively low cortical activation in brighter as compared to less intelligent individuals but this expected neural efficiency pattern interacted with sex and task content: In the verbal Posner task, the females were more likely to produce cortical activation patterns in line with the neural efficiency hypothesis, whereas in the figural task, primarily the males displayed the expected inverse relationship between IQ and cortical activation.}

abstract = {Previous studies demonstrated that intelligence is significantly related to an impressive array of psychological, social, biological and genetic factors and that working memory (WM) can be considered as a general cognitive resource strongly related with a wide variety of higher order cognitive competencies and intelligence. Also, evaluating the WM of subjects might allow one to test the neural efficiency hypothesis (NEH). WM typically involves functional interactions between frontal and parietal cortices. We recorded EEG signals to study neuronal interactions during one WM test in individuals who had few years of formal education (LE) as compared to individuals with university degrees (UE). The two groups of individuals differed in the scores they obtained in psychological tests. To quantify the synchronization between EEG channels in several frequency bands, we evaluated the “synchronization likelihood” (SL), which takes into consideration nonlinear processes as well as linear ones. SL was then converted into graphs to estimate the distance from “small-world network” (SWN) organization, i.e., an optimally organized network that would give rise to the data. In comparison to LE subjects, those with university degrees exhibited less prominent SWN properties in most frequency bands during the WM task. This finding supports the NEH and suggests that the connections between brain areas of well-educated subjects engaged in WM tasks are not as well-organized in the sense of SWN.}

abstract = {In the field of physiological study of human intelligence, strong evidence of a more efficient operation (i.e., less activation) of the brain in brighter individuals (the neural efficiency hypothesis) can be found. Most studies in this field have used single, homogeneous tasks and have not examined sex differences. In analyzing the extent of Event-related Desynchronization (ERD) in the EEG during the performance of a verbal and a visuo-spatial task, we recently found that males and females display neural efficiency primarily in the domain where they usually perform better (i.e., verbal in females and spatial in males; cf. A.C. Neubauer, A. Fink, D.G. Schrausser, Intelligence and neural efficiency: the influence of task content and sex on brain–IQ relationship. Intelligence, 30 (2002) 515–536). However, this interpretation was complicated by differences in the complexity of the two tasks. By using a verbal (semantic) and a spatial (rotation) task of comparable complexity in this research, we sought to replicate and extend our earlier findings by additionally considering the individual differences in intelligence structure and the topographical distribution over the cortex. Findings were similar to the previous study: Females (n = 35) display neural efficiency (i.e., less brain activation in brighter individuals) primarily during the verbal task, males (n = 31) in the spatial task. However, the strength of this brain activation–IQ relationship varies with the intelligence factor: In males, the highest correlations were observed for spatial IQ, in females for verbal IQ. Furthermore, the sexes displayed topographical differences of neural efficiency patterns.}
