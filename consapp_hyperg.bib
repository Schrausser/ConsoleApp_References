abstract = {Publisher Summary
The Arithmetica infinitorum was a key text in the 17th-century transition from geometry to algebra and in the development of infinite series and the integral calculus. The text contains the infinite fraction for 4/π that is now his chief claim to fame; but for his contemporaries, the most significant feature was the introduction of new methods, new concepts, and new vocabulary. Wallis came to Oxford with no more than a little self-taught mathematics, but within a few years, produced his most important work, the Arithmetica infinitorum. The Arithmetica infinitorum stands both chronologically and mathematically at the mid point of the 17th century, drawing together the best ideas from the first half of the century, the algebraic geometry of René Descartes, and the theory of indivisibles of Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598–1647), and preparing the ground for some of the astonishing advances of the second half: the discovery of the general binomial theorem, applications of infinite series, and the integral calculus.}

 abstract = {This paper reviews the problems that bedevil the selection of an appropriate test for the analysis of a 2 × 2 table. In contradiction to an earlier paper, the author now argues the case for the use of Fisher's exact test. It is noted that all test statistics for the 2 × 2 table have discrete distributions and it is suggested that it is irrational to prescribe an unattainable fixed significance level. The use of mid-P is suggested, if a formula is required for prescribing a variable tail probability. The problems of two-tail tests are discussed.},

abstract={It is demonstrated in this paper that two major tests for 2 × 2 talbes are highly related from a Bayesian perspective. Although it is well-known that Fisher's exact and Pearson's chi-square tests are asymptotically equivalent, the present analysis shows that a formal similarity also exists in small samples. The key assumption that leads to the resemblance is the presence of a continuous parameter measuring association. In particular, it is shown that Pearson's probability can be obtained by integrating a two-moment approximation to the posterior distribution of the log-odds ratio. Furthermore, Pearson's chi-square test gave an excellent approximation to the actual Bayes probability in all 2×2 tables examined, except for those with extremely disproportionate marginal frequencies.},
