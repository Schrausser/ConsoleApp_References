abstract="Experiments usually produce a discrete set of data points. If additional data points are needed, for instance, to draw a continuous curve or to change the sampling frequency of audio or video signals, interpolation methods are necessary. But interpolation is also helpful to develop more sophisticated numerical methods for the calculation of numerical derivatives or integrals. Polynomial interpolation is discussed in large detail together with its drawbacks. The methods by Lagrange and Newton are discussed, as well as the Neville method, which allow efficient determination and evaluation of the interpolating polynomial. For interpolation over a larger range, larger number of data spline interpolation is very useful which does not show the oscillatory behavior characteristic of polynomial interpolation. In a computer experiment both these approaches are compared. Multivariate interpolation is a necessary tool to process multidimensional data sets, for instance, for image processing. A computer experiment compares bilinear interpolation and bicubic spline interpolation.",

abstract = {Newton’s interpolation is a classical polynomial interpolation approach and plays a significant role in numerical analysis and image processing. The interpolation function of most classical approaches is unique to the given data. In this paper, univariate and bivariate parameterized Newton-type polynomial interpolation methods are introduced. In order to express the divided differences tables neatly, the multiplicity of the points can be adjusted by introducing new parameters. Our new polynomial interpolation can be constructed only based on divided differences with one or multiple parameters which satisfy the interpolation conditions. We discuss the interpolation algorithm, theorem, dual interpolation, and information matrix algorithm. Since the proposed novel interpolation functions are parametric, they are not unique to the interpolation data. Therefore, its value in the interpolant region can be adjusted under unaltered interpolant data through the parameter values. Our parameterized Newton-type polynomial interpolating functions have a simple and explicit mathematical representation, and the proposed algorithms are simple and easy to calculate. Various numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},
