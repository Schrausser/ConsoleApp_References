abstract="The Poisson distribution is a discontinuous distribution which was described by the French mathematician Sim{\'e}on Denis Poisson (1781-2013;1840) in a book published in 1837. The Poisson distribution is a particular case of the binomial distribution (chapter 17) where the probability p becomes smaller and smaller (p {\textrightarrow} 0) while the exponent k becomes larger and larger (k{\textrightarrow}∞) in such a way that their product, the mean, $\mu$= kp, keeps a finite value (0 < $\mu$ = kp < ∞). The Poisson distribution might thus be defined by the following equation",

abstract="The Poisson distribution is of great importance in theory and in practice. It has the added virtue of being a simple mathematical object. We could have introduced it at an earlier stage in the book, and the reader was alerted to this in {\textsection}4.4. However, the belated entrance will give it more prominence, as well as a more thorough discussion than would be possible without the benefit of the last two chapters.",

 abstract = {Social determinists have argued that the occurrence of independent discoveries and inventions demonstrates the inevitability of techno-scientific progress. Yet the frequency of such multiples may be adequately predicted by a probabilistic model, especially the Poisson model suggested by Price. A detailed inquiry reveals that the Poisson distribution can predict almost all the observed variation in the frequency distribution of multiples collected by Merton, and by Ogburn and Thomas. This study further indicates that: (a) the number of observed multiples may be greatly underestimated, particularly those involving few independent contributors; (b) discoveries and inventions are not sufficiently probable to avoid a large proportion of total failures, and hence techno-scientific advance is to a large measure indeterminate; (c) chance or 'luck' seems to play such a major part that the 'great genius' theory is no more tenable than the social deterministic theory.},
