abstract = {Let (Xt) be the solution of a stochastic differential system. We consider the following situations: computation of Eƒ(Xt) by a Monte-Carlo method (for example, computation of moments of the solution); integration of ƒ(·) with respect to the invariant probability law of (Xt) (when this process is ergodic); or of the upper Lyapunov exponent, by simulating a single trajectory. We propose to perform an extrapolation between approximate values due to first-order schemes; we show that this algorithm (simpler to implement than second-order schemes) provides a second-order accuracy, and we give results of numerical tests.}

abstract = {Summary Elementary techniques for computing a definite integral use the fundamental theorem of calculus. This chapter discusses more sophisticated techniques that yield accurate approximations with less computational effort. It surveys two methods for enhancing the accuracy of composite quadrature formulas. The first method, Romberg quadrature, uses approximations to the integral that have low-order accuracy to compute high-order approximations. The second approach, adaptive quadrature, encompasses a class of strategies for tailoring composite formulas to local, idiosyncratic behavior in the integrand. The chapter also explores the theory of Gauss quadrature. In doing so, it generalizes the framework based on the Legendre polynomials, to include other Gauss quadrature methods based on different orthogonal systems of polynomials. In each case, there is a specific interval of integration associated with the basic quadrature method. However, each method readily extends to more general intervals via the change-of-variables tactic.}

 abstract = {Simulation methods [particularly Efron's (1979) bootstrap] are being applied more and more frequently in statistical inference. Given data (X1, ..., Xn) distributed according to P, which belongs to a hypothesized model P, the basic goal is to estimate the distribution LP of a function Tn(X1, ..., Xn, P). The bootstrap presupposes the existence of an estimate P̂(X1, ..., Xn) and involves estimating Lp by the distribution L*n of Tn(X*1, ..., X*n, P̂), where (X*1, ..., X*n) is distributed according to P̂. The method is of particular interest when L*n, though known in principle, can realistically only be computed by simulation. Such computation can be expensive if n is large and Tn is complex (e.g., see the multivariate goodness-of-fit tests of Beran and Millar 1986). Even when bootstrap application to a single data set is not excessively expensive, Monte Carlo studies of the bootstrap are another matter. We propose a method based on the classical ideas of Richardson extrapolation for reducing the computational cost inherent in bootstrap simulations and Monte Carlo studies of the bootstrap, by performing simulations for statistics based on two smaller sample sizes. We study theoretically which ratio of the two small sample sizes is apt to give best results. We show how our method works for approximating the χ2, t, and smoothed binomial distributions, and for setting bootstrap percentile confidence intervals for the variance of a normal distribution with a mean of 0.},

abstract = { Richardson extrapolation is a classical technique from numerical analysis that can improve the approximation error of an estimation method by combining linearly several estimates obtained from different values of one of its hyperparameters without the need to know in details the inner structure of the original estimation method. The main goal of this paper is to study when Richardson extrapolation can be used within data science beyond the existing applications to step-size adaptations in stochastic gradient descent. We identify two situations where Richardson interpolation can be useful: (1) when the hyperparameter is the number of iterations of an existing iterative optimization algorithm with applications to averaged gradient descent and Frank--Wolfe algorithms (where we obtain asymptotically rates of \$O(1/k^2)\$ on polytopes, where \$k\$ is the number of iterations) and (2) when it is a regularization parameter with applications to Nesterov smoothing techniques for minimizing nonsmooth functions (where we obtain asymptotically rates close to \$O(1/k^2)\$ for nonsmooth functions) and kernel ridge regression. In all these cases, we show that extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance but with sometimes strong gains, and we provide theoretical justifications based on asymptotic developments for such gains, as well as empirical illustrations on classical problems from machine learning. }

The proofs are entirely based on finite element techniques and extend to situations where no ``discrete'' maximum principle is available.

This interest is due to its practicality and the improvement of highspeed calculations done on current century processors. The increase in numerical method tools in engineering software, such as Matlab, is an example of the increased interest. In this paper, we are present a new improved numerical integration method, that is based on the well-known trapezoidal rule. The proposed method gives a great enhancement to the trapezoidal rule and overcomes the issue of the error value when dealing with some higher order functions even when solving for a single interval. After literature review, the proposed system is mathematically explained along with error analysis. Few examples are illustrated to prove improved accuracy of the proposed method over traditional trapezoidal method.}

In this formulation, a boundary integral over a smooth, closed hypersurface is transformed into an equivalent volume integral defined in a sufficiently thin tubular neighborhood of the surface. The volumetric formulation makes it possible to use the simple trapezoidal rule on uniform Cartesian grids and relieves the need to use parameterization for developing quadrature. Consequently, typical point singularities in a layer potential extend along the surface's normal lines. We propose new higher-order corrections to the trapezoidal rule on the grid nodes around the singularities. This correction is based on local decompositions of the singularity and is dependent on the angle of approach to the singularity relative to the surface's principal curvature directions. The proposed decomposition, combined with the volumetric formulation, leads to a special quadrature error cancellation.}

This chapter discusses the trapezoidal rule integration formulas. The development of numerical integration formulas as such is not in the mainstream of the mathematical topics covered in the chapter. The modified trapezoidal rule uses functional values at points which lie midway between those points that apply for the trapezoidal rule. There is a certain class of transcendental functions defined by integrals which can be computed to high accuracy by use of these rules; with a view toward the applications, the chapter takes up this aspect of the subject. Algorithms for the evaluation of definite integrals by means of equally spaced data are closely related to the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula for which there is a vast literature. Comparison of the two formulations shows that the difference in accuracy is negligible.}

The advantage of the Trapezoidal rule is that it is simple to use and can be applied to a wide range of functions. Since the Trapezoidal rule is an approximation rule, it will yield an error. In this study, we aim to reduce the error of the Trapezoidal rule can be reduced by applying mean averaging toward Trapezoidal rule called as Trapezoidal rule with mean averaging, TRMEAN. The arithmetic mean, geometric mean, Harmonic mean, Heronian mean, Contra harmonic, Root-mean-square mean, and Centroidal mean will be implemented. Hence, we will be experimented as examples before concluding the results. The results of this study showed that the error from TRMEAN is smaller as compared to TR. The findings indicate that TRMEAN presents a promising improvement in accuracy and reliability for this task over the original TR method.
