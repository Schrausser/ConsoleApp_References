abstract="This chapter first describes in Sect. 15.1 the t-distribution introduced by Gosset (1908) and its multivariate extensions, in the form of the multivariate t-distribution, Hotelling's T2-statistic and the F-distribution, all derived from sampling theory of a normal (or multivariate normal) distribution with unknown variance (or covariance matrix). It then develops the asymptotic distributions of these self-normalized sample means even when the population has infinite second moment. Related results such as the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for these self-normalized statistics are also described.",

ABSTRACT = {In this work, we present a new generalization of the student’s t distribution. The new distribution is obtained by the quotient of two independent random variables. This quotient consists of a standard Normal distribution divided by the power of a chi square distribution divided by its degrees of freedom. Thus, the new symmetric distribution has heavier tails than the student’s t distribution and extensions of the slash distribution. We develop a procedure to use quantile regression where the response variable or the residuals have high kurtosis. We give the density function expressed by an integral, we obtain some important properties and some useful procedures for making inference, such as moment and maximum likelihood estimators. By way of illustration, we carry out two applications using real data, in the first we provide maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the generalized student’s t distribution, student’s t, the extended slash distribution, the modified slash distribution, the slash distribution generalized student’s t test, and the double slash distribution, in the second we perform quantile regression to fit a model where the response variable presents a high kurtosis.},

abstract = {In this paper we provide rather weak conditions on a distribution which would guarantee that the t-statistic of a random vector of order n follows the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. The results sharpen the earlier conclusions of Mauldon [Characterizing properties of statistical distributions, Quart. J. Math. 2(7) (1956) 155–160] and the more recent advances due to Bondesson [When is the t-statistic t-distributed, Sankhyā, Ser. A 45 (1983) 338–345]. The basic tool involved in the derivations is the vertical density representation originally suggested by Troutt [A theorem on the density of the density ordinate and an alternative interpretation of the Box–Muller method, Statistics 22(3) (1991) 463–466; Vertical density representation and a further remark on the Box–Muller method, Statistics 24 (1993) 81–83]. Several illustrative examples are presented.}

 abstract = {We develop a Bayesian analysis based on two different Jeffreys priors for the Student-t regression model with unknown degrees of freedom. It is typically difficult to estimate the number of degrees of freedom: improper prior distributions may lead to improper posterior distributions, whereas proper prior distributions may dominate the analysis. We show that Bayesian analysis with either of the two considered Jeffreys priors provides a proper posterior distribution. Finally, we show that Bayesian estimators based on Jeffreys analysis compare favourably to other Bayesian estimators based on priors previously proposed in the literature.},
